# 🧠 YOLO: Computer Vision with Transfer Learning and Optimization

This project demonstrates how to apply **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection, integrate it into a **Flask API**, and deploy it using **AWS Lambda**. It also includes complementary examples like ARIMA time series forecasting.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Object Detection with YOLO
- 🌐 REST API using Flask
- ☁️ AWS Lambda deployment with a ready-to-use handler
- 📈 ARIMA-based forecasting
- 📦 Clean modular structure with scripts, notebooks, and documentation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (YOLO, Flask, ARIMA)
- **HTML/CSS** (for simple frontend testing)
- **AWS Lambda** (serverless deployment)
- **Shell Scripting**
