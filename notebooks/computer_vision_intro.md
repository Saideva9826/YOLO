# Computer Vision: An Introduction

Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers and machines to interpret, analyze, and understand visual data from the world around us, such as images and videos. It allows computers to "see" and derive meaningful information, recognize objects, identify patterns, and make decisions based on visual inputs. This interdisciplinary field uses techniques from machine learning and deep learning to achieve its goals.
