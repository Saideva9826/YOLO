# YOLO (You Only Look Once)

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm that has revolutionized the field of computer vision. Developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi in 2015, it is a single-stage object detector that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities of objects in input images in a single pass. This makes YOLO significantly faster than previous multi-stage object detection systems, enabling real-time image analysis.
