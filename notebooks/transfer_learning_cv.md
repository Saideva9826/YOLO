# Transfer Learning in Computer Vision

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second, related task. In computer vision, this typically involves using pre-trained models (models trained on very large datasets like ImageNet) as a feature extractor or as an initial set of weights for a new model.

Key benefits of transfer learning in computer vision:

*   **Reduced Training Time:** Instead of training a model from scratch, which can take a long time and require vast amounts of data, transfer learning allows for faster convergence.
*   **Less Data Required:** It's particularly useful when you have a limited amount of data for your specific task, as the pre-trained model has already learned a rich set of features from a much larger dataset.
*   **Improved Performance:** By leveraging knowledge from a pre-trained model, the new model often achieves better performance than a model trained from scratch on a smaller dataset.
*   **Versatility:** Pre-trained models can be adapted to a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

Common scenarios for transfer learning:

1.  **Feature Extraction:** The pre-trained model (excluding its final classification layer) is used as a fixed feature extractor. The output of this feature extractor is then fed into a new classifier (e.g., a simple neural network or SVM) that is trained on the new dataset.
2.  **Fine-tuning:** The pre-trained model's weights are used as an initialization, and then some or all of its layers are re-trained (fine-tuned) on the new dataset. This allows the model to adapt the learned features more specifically to the new task.
